Cutting edge work will never be wholly reproducible. When working with new results, new methods, new systems - one can never be certain.  2. And when publishing standards are what they are, especially in your journal - one cannot spend 1 year on each experiment. Consider examining one of your most recent Articles and think realistically about how long it would take a single person to perform each of those experiments to the highest standard of rigor. Be sure to consider that many of those methods had to be learned and developed. 3. The ""crisis"" is driven by people that are ignorant of science and the scientific method - many of them actually scientists. They believe science is truth, and that all data should be 100% reproducible. When they find results that are not, they think this is misconduct. It's as if they've never been at the front lines seeing new results for the first time. Certain there are rare examples of misconduct, but most of irreproducibility is just Science in Practice. And indeed science in practice of the influence of Nature Science Cell. 4. There is a crisis of publishing standards. Anyone can examine a manuscript and consider realistically the rigor with which experiments were performed given the scope. For example editors have no problem asking scientists to perform 2 years equiv of mouse experiments in the review, and do not think twice when these are complete in 6 months.   Science is and will always be uncertain. Reproducibility is what drives some results forward but is not a quality of all. Publishing standards and competition that increase the quantity required, decrease the quality and thereby harm reproducibility. The only crisis is the effect of Nature Sciece Cell on science."

Strongly agree	Agree	I think biology is particularly fraught with this because of the inherent variability in model systems. The more controlled the less well it represents a living organism. It makes spurious results more common than say physics or chemistry. Across all fields the pressure to publish a flagship paper to get and keep a job is a profound incentive not to look beyond the first positive result for fear it falls apart. The review system further incentivizes non-reproducible results asking for enormous additional work to be done in a short time frame so as not to lost the time already invested in the review process and risk starting over. I doubt anything added in revision is ever reproduced by the primary authors. Lastly the gold standard of animal work in biology combined with the expense and duration of these studies means one animal exit is often sufficient for publication. This is bad for science but raising the bar prices junior face out of the game.

Problems arise because at the P=0.05 level, 1/20 experiments will seem to be reproducible when they aren't.  And also because some scientists are only as honest as they have to be.  (But reproducibilty barely applies at all in the What HappeneD sciences, unlike the What HappenS sciences  MUCH damage is done through false takl about reproducibility in e.g. palaeonology - and in the pages of Nature. From The Secret Dinobird Story:  ""Another misunderstanding is the use made of “repeatability” – a particular requirement in physical sciences where knowledge is in the form of general laws. One task in e.g. physics is to find laws (the process of induction). They must be general – that’s why they must be repeatable. Once we have the laws, they can be employed to predict the future (deduction). However in historical sciences the course of actual events is our quarry: we have to force any general laws (of varying reliability) to run backwards, usually in complex combinations, to work out what actually happened (abduction: Peirce 1955).   From Sciencepolice-14 Rules:  14) Historical disciplines (e.g. palaeontology and archaeology) often test by future discovery, not experiment. In such disciplines, evidence and demonstration may be probabilistic or qualitative, and rely on complex variously valid world models left in individual minds by diverse experiences. Typically, historical sciences theorise past events given present evidence (abduction). Inductive sciences invent laws, or describe/model structures or processes; ‘applied sciences’ deduce futures or achieve goals. Despite differences, many principles apply to all sciences, though the importance of repeatability for inductive sciences does not make it a basic principle of historical disciplines.

Yes	"My work deals with theoretical models of macromolecules. We have a check list of requisites and protocols that allow us to validate simulated data claims.

It takes extra work to adhere some new protocol. On the long term, it helps maximizing the positive outcomes. But in the short term it is expensive to adopt a scheme for publishing reproducible results. With this paradigm, however, I did recently reported an error in one of the equations used in a research published by a major journal. That paper was (sadly) approved by the editors in just two days during Christmas, and hence it was a lack of due diligence by the reviewers-whom get impressed by the list of authors, five out of six who are among the most cited in my field. But they did have to send a correction.  "	I am unsure	At this point there are uncertainties regarding computational simulations reproducibility. Most mainstream journals fall for innovative new super-expensive simulations that nobody but the authors can replicate... That is a very sad perspective in my field because it creates a unequal access to those journals. I always wonder if e.g. NPG Editors will really be interested on publishing pure theoretical papers which are easier to verify and/or disproof.	Yes	"The barriers I can identify are within the peer review system that is facing a huge challenge: most reputed scientists refuse to peer review themselves and journals are requiring help from less seasoned researchers. At one extreme, I did get recently a review from someone who barely can write in English and showed a total lack of knowledge in the field. This was from a Royal Society journal. So how is the landscape for less known journals? We need a better peer review system. That is beyond the efforts of my lab.

But those are exceptional projects, not the rule in science. They hardly can be corroborated by anyone. Hence, why insisting on reporting them? Scientific journals should report what scientists can replicate--not only in principle. My point is that mainstream journals have a lot to do: most of retractions and misconduct in recent times involved several Nature or Science papers that nobody could reproduce but the original authors.

Firstly, more than one person does each experiment, secondly, absolutely no experiment is done fewer than 10 times (luckily we don't work with animals), the lab 'rule of ten', we quantify and statistically analyse data, and then most important of all, spend inordinate amounts of time helping other groups establish our protocols. one example - a few yrs ago we discovered a particular enzyme was inactive in its wild type state, contrary to the prevailing dogma at the time. took us 3 years to publish it, there was a lot of resistance, turned out that if the protein was n-terminally tagged, it was inappropriately activated. another lab was struggling to reproduce our data, a cursory glance at purification procedure showed they were pooling fractions of purified enzyme, including a fraction that still had tagged material in it, thus the entire 'pot of enzyme' they had made was contaminated. god knows how many people they had told it was impossible to reproduce our findings, but it was simply because they were not careful scientists. of course as soon as they used the purified protein they saw exactly what we saw."

I always start by going through the protocols painstakingly - hilariously people think they know better how to purify the protein so they add steps like dialysis, or decide not to cleave the tag because it makes the purification 'easier', almost every time, they are not following the procedure. i think i really go out of my way with this, in the last 3 years we have sent one group every single component of an assay they were struggling to reproduce, along with the results we had just generated, and they were able to combinatorially replace each one and discover which one of their components was the culprit. a long discussion later, turned out that when performing size-exclusion chromatography, they separated the aggregates from the 'good' protein, but then pooled them all together again at the end - this is due to ignorance of basic biochemistry principles, perhaps mouse geneticists shouldn't be doing protein chemistry. Second, we have in the last year hosted researchers from other labs in our own for a week when we have been unable to identify what they are doing differently just in discussion. So far, 100% success rate. We work with challenging proteins, it is not unreasonable to encounter difficulties with something we have spent 10 years working with, but i do think that the drive for 'interdisciplinarity' which actually comes from the review process, is a major part of the problem. one of personal favourites in my field is how the original researchers in the field who were clinicians, took a protein that requires 8 zinc ions to fold correctly, and added EDTA, a divalent cation chelating-agent to the buffers, because that's what they were used to using.

Medical Systems Biology approached ""promised"" to deliver based on all kind of -omics approaches to deliver a platform of new biomarkers in order to understand and ""fight"" modern complex welfare diseases via this multifacetted SYSTEMS approach but: due to a lack of ""analytical"" personal who run the very complicated scientific tools (eg. proton-NMR & LCMS), there is on one hand 1). Lack of Biochemical knowledge to understand the mechanism behind this biomarker and a modern welfare diseases; 3). Simple multivariate statistical analysis techniques are applied to ""define"" and ""distinguish"" the biomarker but the biochemical pathogenesis is not understood and needs the knowledge of (bio)medical researchers; 3). Systems Biology (on all levels: genomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics) makes the ""error"" to describe based on solely one biomarker the pathogenesis of a modern welfare disease and thus falls back to a REDUCTIONISTIC APPROACH=> one gene=> one disease (old reductionims with transgenic knock-in &-out mouse models (polymorphism!!). While the Medical Systems Approach also follows in most cases a reductionistic approach=> one biomerker (mechanism not understood) => one multifactorial disease. I'm willing to describe my ""critisism"" on the Medical Systems Biology approach and its so called personalized medical treatment (which is far away) and is from ethical perception: A proper right medical treatment for 1). The right person; 2). Given the right treatment; 3). Born on the right location (developed world). Considering the fact that obesity and its burden of chronic degenerative economic very costly welfare diseases (CDs) costed the US in 2012 around 16 trilion US dollar (NEJM Frieden 2012) nearly corresponding to the GDP (Worldbank) we have to reconsider the role of ""modern"" medicine and its tremendous expensive search for ""biomarkers"". We live in a dispersed world where one billion people are obese/Type-2 diabetes/its burden of non-communicable diseases makes a country like the US nearly bancrupt. While fighting hunger (one billion, two billion malnourished) costs solely 800 billion US dollars (FAO 2005). Despite the tremendous effort at the global pandemic of obesity and DM2/IR and its burden no new by Medical Systems Biology biomarker is used in a ""Personalized Medical Treatment"", but the simple fructosamine test is still on a global scale for the five regions applied for solely the adult population (and not the elderly or children=> childhood obesity).

The process of discovery requires reproducibility.

Holding companies accountable for the quality of their product and providing information regarding constituents of media would be VERY VERY VERY impactful. All scientific labs are at the mercy of suppliers of scientific reagents and equipment.

Due to the role of journal publishers (as editors of structure and format rather than content--which is regulated largely by reviewers) these efforts must perforce be upon how data is submitted, rather than the nature of the experiments done or the consistency of the data--which are the purview of the reviewers, largely.  Because journals must assess many types of data collection methods it is difficult to place standards.  However, journals could do more to require basic control data to be available in a supplemental form (for example online) as recommended by experts in each field of data collection.  For example, flow cytometry experts would dismiss most flow data shown in papers as incomplete as at best, isotype controls are the only controls shown, when doing extremely complex studies involving 10+ variables.  Journals are moving towards this, however, which is good, but until there is a format for control data to be available and required without swamping the point of the paper, it will be a problem."

Crowd-sourced reviews can highlight problems and strong points in data that are missed by individual reviewers in the review process.  This and including raw data in papers so that the actual lab notebook data (virtual or scanned in) was included as an amendment with every paper would do a lot to prevent sloppy work from benefitting those who do it.

The methods must be described clearly enough to recreate the exact same experiment. As simple and elementary as this seems, many papers fail to meet this, ie. ""we filtered the sequence data"" without saying through which program, with what parameters, to narrow to down to sequences with what quality score, etc.  On another level, the results must be reproducible. If the sample size is large enough, one should obtain a representative idea of reality, but it seems this does not always happen.  Lastly, and related to the above, it's often the anomolous results that get published rather than the norm. This is very harmful and wasteful. There are probably thousands of similar experiments performed in different labs that never get written about because of negative results. When negative, or ""non-interesting"" results are not published, it's more likely that another lab will request funding to perform a similar experiment-and will likely also obtain ""unpublishable"" results. This incorrectly portrays reality and wastes time, money, and resources.

This is a manuscript dealing with electronic properties. It is known that in this case electronic properties are very sensitive to buckling here. The authors did not mention what kind of buckling they have used LB or HB and what results are consistent with the experiments. Lattice constants of only substrate is provided.

"	I am unsure	"There is always scope for improvement and no method or procedure is fool proof, so I guess we are also not perfect like every body else. We have recently started having an internal peer review on experimental basis from a fellow faculty colleague to provide an unbiased review of our data and manuscripts that we submit for publication. We will see if this works well we will try to implement on larger scale. There are other problems with this. There are all kinds of people in every walk of life some of them honest and some dishonest which comes from human behavior.

All author information including geographical location should be available only at the editorial staff level. One of the major reasons why undeserving (which includes non reproducible and bogus) manuscripts are published is a bias on treatment of manuscripts due to contacts with editors and affiliation of the authors. This leads to sending of manuscripts to preferred reviewers who are known to the authors. This information should be available to the editor only after the manuscript is accepted. In my opinion an unbiased review by an expert can tell whether the results are dependable/reproducible or not. There are several reviewers at the level of postdoctoral and many times at graduate student level (PhD) more commonly in lower impact journal, who I do not think have the insight to review a manuscript. Journals like nature & allied should try to ensure that the reviewers are faculty members. The problem here is that it is a common practice that many senior professors pass on the manuscript to their graduate students instead of reviewing themselves. May be incentive driven peer review (with review report evaluated by editor, it is fairly easy to figure out who has written the review report)will help in this case by providing credits which could be used for publishing at reduced fees in open access journals published by the group. So lot of reform at the editorial and peer review level can  be done to fix this issue significantly.   Some points mentioned are very subjective 1) Verification of experimental data by outside labs. There are issues of conflict of interests especially if research is in high impact area and moreover the lab verifying those results do not get any incentive for doing that, and you know that no journal will except a manuscript containing data verification only so why would one do it. 2) It is almost impossible to have a fool-proof check list there are so many different kind of procedures calculations. It is easier for specialized journal to do this rather than for journal like nature or even the sister publications of nature.

I worry less about the latter because my field, geology, tends to discount all field work until it has been repeated by multiple parties or it completely agrees with our theoretical expectation.  This means surprising results are not the issue so much as sloppy field work by poorly trained workers often master's students is uncritically accepted as long as it says what we expect.    But with foreign research we are both too critical and not critical enough in that most experienced researchers are extremely suspicious of results from local researchers in certain locales such as China but are not willing to be forthright about this, which allows such results to appear in publication without direct challenge.  Which means that researchers not in direct personal communication with the main streams of research do not understand this.  So in this sense we have a failure of peer review more than a reproducibility crisis  What I mean is that in most published research the huge place where we have a reproducibility issue is in field work, nobody actually goes to the middle of no where and checks field data until the result has already been either accepted or challenged and when they do if the investigator is not challenging it but attempting refinement or using initial work as a start point they are usually very reluctant to recognize how bad the initial data collection was.  But in geochemistry there is also a problem with methods being accepted and implemented without investigating the proxies, I think the latter is not caused by what everyone is calling the reproducibility crisis but by a lack of statistical knowledge by researchers and a lack of either appropriate chemistry training by field investigators crossed with a lack of basic geology by lab workers.

Industry is better about this than government because a failure to reproduce in preliminary stage will often allow them to cancel funding, but generally makes them happier with the researcher.  With other funding bodies reproduction is seen as a waste of scarce resources.  I think this has to do with how funding is arranged, when you get a grant from an agency they are approving entire project while industry is paying for defined steps."

Outright fraud by investigators who know what will be checked and what won't.  The pure pychopath.  2. Sloppy motivated thinking that starts tossing results that are problematic or cultivates sampling techniques that are cherry picking, combined with changing methods but not reproducing on old results, so you get a combination of methods.  Weirdly I have seen this actually described in a published paper, and more often openly communicated by researcher in person.  This comes from a poor example from mentors.  It is a continuum.  3.  Bad technique that is purely honest in intention, usually caused by a failure to understand other work.

One suggestion is that when a researcher's dataset is used they should get something more than a citation, maybe even some sort of co authorship level.  This would make collecting and maintaining data sets attractive to university departments.  Checking notebooks and other forensic methods will only work for those trained in these methods.  My initial education was as an accountant and even then I only learned to detect fraud and data manipulation from work experience and even most auditors did not know what to look for unless it was pointed out to them.  Unless you enforce a very rigid procedural standard, such as requiring everything to be reported in a field book/lab book with no attachments don't allow clean copies, require neat strike through, and abolish erasers, plus keep a forensic record of code revision and digital work you are not going to get anywhere with field books except with the most honest researchers, and even then we are scientists and not policemen or tax inspectors and not trained in this work.

The result is that young scientists fail to publish evolutionary and uncomfortable new ideas. The old garbage is protected, money is wasted.  4. The members of advisory boards for grants are not fair, if their institution or their own former publications must be revised. (Save the authority in your field.) 5. The envy of the peers and authorities. This observation is suppressed in the public. The peer review system fails regularly due to envy. Simple solution: Make the names of the peers public and give the defendant the opportunity to appeal. 6. Acceptance of papers is sometimes based on lies and deception. The culture of hard discussion is time consuming, but must be improved.  7. Abolish impact factor, Hirsh index, citation classic and similar classifying efforts.

Poor understanding of statistical descriptors, e.g. the study did not prove the relationship, with informed reader being able to deduce it from the publication; however, the publication over-represents with informal, or out of context terms, terms the significance of the result. Such publications often have discrepancies between main text and supplementary results. In general, I find supplementary results more reliable than the main text. 3. Discrepancy between the results and ""aura"" the publication creates. Publication is formally correct and results can be replicated; however, differently stated  conclusion can be drawn.

Agree	Strongly agree	"The push to publish makes the scientific publications frankly unreliable. They must be rechecked before used.

Working in large groups is also a push to publish results that are not true. Because they are more likely opinions pushed by the social environment and the PI of the project than genuine results. This is especially true in groups with strong leader, which results require double and triple check in order to be used. Also the emerging social network of fair journals reviewers around the editors make very unreliable the publications even in high level journals. Even the blogs in the newspapers of lay people, as an echo to those articles are something that should be read in order to filter the diamonds.  The money for the scientific projects are with a requirement of accountability similar to any business activity. But in fact they should be treated as extremely high risk investment. It should be understood by the organizations that give money for R+I that a negative result of an investigation is a norm, not exception.

For example, not like old times, science is not business of close cirle people, most of whom know each other. In many areas science is becoming a productive force and scientific results bring to their creators sizeable returns. More and more peoples are involved into research and not all of them follow the rules of science ethics. In many cases they even do not know these rules. And these facts affect behaviour of scientists in some areas of research.  I am working in high energy physics. It's a pure science and nobody expects some economic returns from it. In many cases to get a good result  here you need to organise a collaboration of many scientific groups and laboratories.  So you share all the efforts and results. So in my area situation is little bit different. But, of course, many other areas seem to follow in the future the same way."

Talking about ""hot papers"", ""impact factors"", and ""prestigious journals"" gives the impression that good scientists should primarily produce these, forgoing the need to check that results are indeed reliable.   In my field, synthetic organic chemistry, studies are often reproduced relatively quickly by other scientists. Nevertheless, an unacceptably large fraction of synthetic methods published in the literature cannot be reproduced at all even when an attempt is made to reproduce them by competent researchers. ""At all"" means that _no_ desired product is formed. It would be understandable that the yields cannot always be reproduced exactly, but the fact that no desired products are formed when an attempt is made to reproduce the results is alarming.   Unfortunately, this state of affairs is not corrected by adopting an attitude that ""this happens somewhere else, not here"". The entire community is to be blamed, not individual scientists. Scientists should be completely retrained to value good quality, not high-impact papers. Unfortunately, too often this only happens at a later stage in their career when they have already secured a faculty position, but young entrants to the field are ""left to the lions"" and expected to produce something great and preferably quickly.

It is all very well finding new and amazing results that get published in high-ranking journals, but if these cannot be reproduced in other institutions by other scientists then they are unreliable. In complex systems, it is difficult to know whether heterogeneity is part of natural variation or whether it is more meaningful. Reproducing results and analysing them as a ""population"" of related results (meta-analysis) is the *only* way to assess how reliable any results are. Unfortunately the scientific publishing system does not make this easy. Replication is seen as lacking in original thought and is given very little kudos. Ultimately, a lack of replication studies leaves complex science without firm foundations. This can lead to waste of time and resources with no clear output for what is an expensive and publicly funded enterprise. Lack of reproducibility is a scandal of our time and has the potential to undermine the reputation of science, not only among fellow scientists but also the potential to impact the public perception of science in negative ways. We need to get this corrected urgently but unfortunately the scientific system as a whole makes this near impossible. It doesn't look like it is going to change any time soon."	0	1	1	1	0		0	There is a significant crisis of reproducibility	Not enough	10%	"...worse than for other scientific fields on average."""	Strongly agree	Agree	In my field (Dementia Research) there is a wide separation between animal studies and humans. Few results from animal studies are investigated fully in the human population. In fact there are too few human population studies of dementia anyway. This leads to poor translation between pre-clinical science and clinical trials. This situation shows no sign of ending.

Dementia research has one very dominant hypothesis that has yet to be confirmed in human population studies and yet has already lead to clinical trials. The field is riddled with bias that stems directly from this hypothesis and I have written about this before. However, because the hypothesis is dominant, any paper critically appraising it is generally rejected from high ranking journals and instead ends up in journals that nobody reads.  Experimental design is generally poor in my field and lacks a systematic approach. Statistics are poorly understood and the whole field suffers from small sample sizes and an underestimation of heterogeneity. Negative results are generally missing in the body of literature leading to difficulties in modelling disease pathways. Interpretations of results are generally only discussed with respect to the dominant hypothesis; a classic case of hypothesis myopia."

Reproducibility has usually taken a back seat. Culture is a runaway train ... not easy to stop or divert. Some individuals/hypotheses are ""too big to fail"" some experimental approaches are a matter of scientific ""habit"". Limitations inherent in all scientific approaches are side-lined in favour of emphasising the potential importance of results ... ""the media effect"".   How do you tackle the ""too big to fail"", ""the habit"" and ""the media effect""?   High ranking journals should be high ranking *because* they are gate-keepers for integrity, not because they are somehow historically established as such. High ranking journals, especially in this age of predatory journals should place scientific integrity at the heart of what they do, something that has been lacking in the past. Reproducibility is one part of this.   The reputations of scientists, and science depend on the integrity of high impact research publishing. I want to trust NPG, I really do, but you really need to clean up your act  In addition to the popularity contest of competing hypotheses, other biases in peer-review also need sorting out. Editors should build a database of reviewers so that they can send a manuscript out for review to different sections of the research community, including those who agree with and those who question the hypothesis being examined in the paper.  Editors should monitor peer-review so that really silly statements do not slip through. (My own personal favourite is ""The concept of senescence is of no use to a biologist"") Peer-review should correct gross errors, clarify experimental methods, highlight limitations and assess how well the evidence supports the conclusions.  Perhaps NPG would consider employing dedicated statistical reviewers ... most peer-reviewers are not good statisticians themselves and the literature in my field is riddled with hopeless statistical errors. This has to stop. (It isn't just NPG, it also affects all high ranking journals JAMA, NEJM, CELL etc....) it is a prevalent problem that is routinely ignored."

We're mitigating this by making the tools easier to use, and embedding reproducibility firmly in our culture. Indeed, this is beginning to enter our undergraduate teaching with the ambition that for the next generation of researchers, conducting experiments with reproducibility in mind is ""all we know"". The net benefit however, is positive, as we firmly believe that we are conducting better studies now, and importantly leave a usable legacy for others to build on."	Yes	"We certainly haven't hit a gold standard for reproducibility yet, and are still in the area where what we are doing is better than nothing.

Yes	"Time is, unsurprisingly, the biggest factor. Developing systems to support reproducibility now has some short term benefit, but the impact is unlikely to be felt for longer, and it can be a difficult sell to convince a postdoc with a short contract to divert time away from their core research to support our reproducibility efforts.

Strongly agree	Strongly agree	"Working in my field now for over 15 years (tenure since 10 years), I witnessed incredible violations of even the most basic ethical rules established over centuries by our scientific forebears. This includes, but is not limited to, the conscious withholding of facts which could or would contradict a pre-perceived result, and the withholding of details necessary for independent verification of results, with the intend to disable the community to discover flaws or the wrongness of a presented result. This, in my opinion and based on my professional experience, led to a steady decline in the trust of published scientific results. Being interested in social aspects of science, I came to realize that this development is, unfortunately, not restricted to my own field, but penetrates all fields I am aware of. Some voices (such as Lee Smolin's) confirm my experiences, and show that the crises even draws towards fields of fundamental importance for the progression of science. It goes beyond the issue of reproducibility of scientific results. The reproducibility crisis is, in my opinion, just the tip of an iceberg, the most apparent problem hinting at a far more severe intrinsic problem with the way science is currently conducted.

The reason is simply that already at the editorial levels of many journals, political interests come into play which all too often override the scientific merits of a submitted work. ""On the field"" (if I may use this phrase) we termed this ""cliquishness"". Editors, as well as Referees, belong to certain cliques which, in turn, favorable or dis-favorable consider a work submitted. For example, work by lesser known authors which challenges the results of a more known author will be dis-favourably looked upon by Editors, in fear of retribution.

In most general terms, reproducibility refers to the credence of scientific claims in empirical research because of the replicability of the evidence presented to support such claims. Unfortunately, and particularly what I have observed in Alzheimer's research throughout the years, credence in scientific claims greatly depend on the status or authority of the originator and most often NOT on the reproducibility of the results. Very often the samples used are amazingly small and lacking ethnic representation, selective reporting and analysis is ubiquitous, and statistical rigor is virtually absent. Most of the journals publishing research in Alzheimer's, allegedly prestigious medical journals, publish research produced with no evidence of statistical analysis rigor. A great number of articles focus on ""clinical relevance"" rather than scientific and statistical rigor. Given the amount of funding received by some of the investigators publishing this research, journals must be required to have a team of statisticians as an integral part of the editorial team. I am appalled by some of the research being published and the grants that some people have received with  an extremely weak or virtually absent strong statistically sound supporting evidence. Some of these ""successfully funded"" NIH grants don't even have a simple power analysis!! Studies including Neuroimaging supporting data are particularly small in sample size, unstandardized in terms of equipment used to obtain imaging data and virtually irreproducible. Yet, NIH funding agencies seem not to acknowledge the importance of reproducibility or replicability of scientific evidence in making decisions about how to allocate their funding. I sincerely hope, as a concerned scientist and statistician, that Reproducibility or replication success, as a defining feature science,  becomes an absolute requirement in any effort characterizing current research practices.
