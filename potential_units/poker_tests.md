# PyPoker Game

**Goal**: using test-driven development processes in Python, create the beginning of a Poker game!

### Resources

  - Poker Hand Rankings: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands
  - Strings for card suits: ♠ ♣ ♥ ♦
  - Strings for cards: http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_games_cards.html
   
### Rules

In every round:
   1. All players get 5 cards in their hand from the deck
   2. Each player gets one chance to replace as many cards from their hand as they like from the deck.
   3. The highest-ranked hand wins (see rankings chart link above).


### Example Tests

Here are some ideas for tests to start with:

  - do cards have a rank?
  - do cards have a suit?
  - do decks contain cards?
  - do decks contain 52 cards?
  - can decks be shuffled?
  - do decks contain only unique cards?
  - do any cards in the deck have a non-french-deck suit?
  - do any cards in the deck have a non-french-deck rank?
  - can you deal 5 cards from a deck?
  - if cards are dealt from the deck, are they removed from the deck?
  - Can a player be given cards?
  - can a player have more than 5 cards?
  - can a player replace cards in her hand with cards from the deck?
  - can two hands of cards be compared?
  - does a hand with the highest high card beat a hand with a lower high card?
  - does a pair of cards in a hand beat a hand with just a high card?
  - ...and so on.
