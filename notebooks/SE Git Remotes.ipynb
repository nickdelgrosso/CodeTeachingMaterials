    "# Git Basics: Adding Git Remotes, Pushing and Pulling\n",
    "\n",
    "What good is keeping tracks of all these versions if we just lose the entire repo by accident, or if we can't put it in a place where others can access it?  In this section, we'll practice telling git where it can send updates to backup repositories *(git remotes)*, sending *(pushing)* new commits to them, and even receiving *(pulling)* new commits on those remotes!  We'll see that GitHub is a useful place to put a git remote, but that we can put a git remote pretty much anywhere, even on other folders in our local computer.\n",
