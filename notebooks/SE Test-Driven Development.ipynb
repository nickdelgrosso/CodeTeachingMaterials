Ideally, we'd spend 100% of our time only writing new features, but when we try to work that way, the code steadily grows into something that has lots of bugs, is difficult to understand, and is difficult to reuse and further modify for new features.  Eventually, to be able to write new features, the coder ends up spending most of their time bug-fixing and refactoring.  Not fun!\n","\n","Test-driven development is a programming practice geared toward doing all of these activities routinely, checking for bugs and cleaning up as we go.  To do this, developers write automated tests at the same time as writing their functions or classes, checking that their code does what they think it does.  To ensure that they have tests in mind, the practice involves writing tests *first*, before writing the code that it tests.  To give developers a chance to be flexible and discover things along the way, the developer doesn't write a lot of tests all at once; instead, they write one test, then the code to pass it, then clean up the code, a process called the **Test-Driven Development Cycle**.\n","\n","![TDD Cycle](https://www.thinktocode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/red-green-refactor.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"8af13322987145a88b3a3c5f4c28ae2a","deepnote_cell_height":69.953125,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[]},"source":["## Writing Automated Tests"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"ae0fa712faa7427a88c24e6c99d0fd2c","deepnote_cell_height":246.234375,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","tags":[]},"source":["### Using the Pytest Test Runner\n","\n","A **Test Runner** looks for automated tests in your code, runs each of them, and displays whether they \n","  - passed (no error message found).  \n","  - failed (an AssertionError was raised)\n","  - errored (any other error was raised)\n","  \n","  **Pytest**'s test runner can detect a wide variety of automated test formats, so it's very popular no matter what kinds of tests are being written.
