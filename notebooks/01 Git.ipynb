    "# Git Basics: Creating Git Repos and Committing Changes to Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a version control system; when added to a project folder *(\"initializing a repository\")*, it has commands that let you add files to be tracked *(\"staging a file\")*, and save a snapshot of your project in a moment in time *(\"committing a change\")*.  You can always ask Git what the current state of that process is *(\"check git's status\")*, and what the history of the project looks like *(\"check git's log\")*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first section, we'll practice the cycle of changing a file, adding it to the list of changes to be committed, and committing it.  We'll get practice with doing it in the terminal and in a VSCode-like IDE. \n",

    "## Terminal Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **`git status`**: Checks what changes are detected by git, what changes are ready to be committed. Used all the time!\n",
    "  - **`git init`**: Creates a new git repository. Used only once, at the beginning of a project.\n",
    "  - **`git add afile.txt`**: Adds a file and its changes to be committed. Done before every commit\n",
    "    - **`git add *`**: Shortcut: Adds all files in the project to be committed.\n",
    "  - **`git commit -m \"my commit message\"`**: Makes a commit with all added files' changes.\n",
    "    - **`git commit -am \"my commit message\"`**: Shortcut: Adds all and Commits, in one step.\n",
    "  - **`git log`**: Checks the log of all past commits.  **To exit the log, press the `q` key.**\n",
    "    - **`git log -1`**: Shortcut, only shows the last one commit.\n",
    "  - **`git diff`**: Compares the files now to the previous commit, showing any differences.\n",
    "  - **`ls -la` or `ll` or `dir`**: Print all the files in the current folder.  Command depends on operating system.\n",
    "  - **`git config --global user.name \"My name\"`**: Tell git which name to sign your commits with (only need to do this the first time git is installed)\n",
    "  - **`git config --global user.email \"myemail@email.com@`**: Tell git which email to sign your commits with (only need to do this the first time git is installed)\n",
