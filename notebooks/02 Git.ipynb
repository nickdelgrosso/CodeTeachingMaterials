    "# Git Basics: Going Back in Time, Creating and Managing Git Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "What good is version control software, if you can't go back to different versions of your repository?  In this section, we'll talk about git's model of the timeline *(\"branches of commits\")* and how it labels the currently-active commit *(\"the HEAD\")*.  We'll move the head to different commits *(\"checking-out\" a commit)*, add multiple timelines to the project *(\"branching\")*, and merge the changes from those different timelines together back into a single timeline *(\"merging branches\")*.\n",

    "## Terminal Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **`git branch`**: Display the list of names of branches in this repository\n",
    "  - **`git branch newbranchname`**: Create a new branch with \"newbranchname\" at the current commit\n",
    "  - **`git branch -d branchname`**: Delete a branch\n",
    "  - **`git log`**: Checks the log of all past commits.  **To exit the log, press the `q` key.**\n",
    "    - **`git log -1`**: Shortcut, only shows the last one commit.\n",
    "  - **`git checkout branchname`**: Make your workspace match the commit at branchname.  \n",
    "  - **`git checkout HEAD~1`**: Make your workspace match the commit one step back in time.\n",
    "  - **`git merge branchname`**: Merges branchname into the current branch"
